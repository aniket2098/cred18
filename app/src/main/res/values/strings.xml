<string name="contraption_rules">1) A team of max. four members is allowed to participate.\n2) Machine should be of dimensions 8ft x 8ft x 8ft (maximum).\n3) Minimum 10 steps should be involved to complete the task otherwise team will be disqualified. However there is no constrain on maximum no. of steps.\n4) Minimum 4 different energy conversion should be implemented in machine. Otherwise team will be disqualified.\n5) Machine should perform the task in maximum of 4 minutes.\n6) Machine should not take support of any of four walls and ceiling.\n7) Teams have to submit abstract and flowchart in prescribed format well before the deadline for first round.\n8) Maximum of three trials/chances will be given to any team. For every other chance/trial there will be deduction of points.\n9) For every next chance reset time of 15 mins will be given to team.\n10) Only one team member is allowed to interact with the machine once the evaluation has begun. This includes resetting the machine during the run. This means that only one person will be allowed inside the arena. However, if the team goes for another run, the restriction of one person inside the arena is uplifted until the machine is ready for the other run.\n11) That person will explain about the machine and each step going on to judges.\n12) Each step in the machine should be considered as the transfer of one energy into another .A step is considered to accomplish when there is energy transformation. Example ball coming down from the wedge and hitting the domino is consider a step. In this potential energy of ball gets changed into kinetic energy while coming down and when it hits the domino, it transfers its energy to domino.\n13) Identical transfers of energy in succession should be considered one step. For eg., a set of dominos falling into each other should be considered one step. While technically each single domino falling is a step, stating one hundred steps for hundred dominos is repetitive and against the spirit of Rube Goldberg.\n14) You can use any material for making of your machine provided in any case , they does not lead damage to arena and other machines. Otherwise it will lead to disqualification of team.\n15) Hazardous materials are not allowed and any gas or any explosives are also not allowed . However you can use matchstick if required provided it does not damage the arena and any other Machine.\n16) We will not provide you any material for making of your Machine. However basic stationary materials will be provided to you.\n17) If required extension boards will be provided to you.\nBut we would really appreciate if you bring of your own.\n18) Bring 2 copies of abstract when you perform in college.\n19) No live animal should be used.\n20) Organizers have the right to change a rule or all if they feel.</string>

    <string name="about_us">Credenz is the annual technical symposium organised by the PICT IEEE Student Branch. Started in 2004, with a view to elicit the best out of each and every one, it has grown to become one of the finest technical events today. Credenz aims not only to infuse a competitive spirit among participants, but also widen their horizons in the ever-changing field of technology via myriad seminars and workshops. Participants get a chance to discover their talents, and thrive in numerous events like Clash, Bplan, RoboLIGA, WebWeaver, Pixelate, Cretronix, Paper Presentation and DataWiz.
This is a unique chance for the students to go beyond the traditional spheres of academics, and make the most of their potential. It was this spirit of learning and discovery that inspired the team to put the entire social experience of the event online in \2009, through the arduous time of the swine flu which made social gatherings impossible. Following this great legacy, the team took Credenz â€™10 to a whole new level, and now the PICT IEEE Student Branch presents to you Credenz â€™18, a podium for you to nurture and cultivate your talents.</string>
